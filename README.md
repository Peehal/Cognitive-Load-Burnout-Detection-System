# Cognitive Load Burnout detection system
This repository contains code and data for predicting stress levels using wearable sensors.

# Project Description
This project investigates the use of physiological signals from wearable devices to detect stress levels . The dataset contains information collected from nurses who wore a watch that recorded their heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity (EDA) while they reported their corresponding levels of stress.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models for predicting stress levels based on the recorded physiological signals. The project also examines which physiological signals are most relevant for detecting stress and provides recommendations for improving the accuracy and reliability of stress detection using wearable technology.

# Results
The project found that the Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier models performed the best for predicting stress levels based on the recorded physiological signals. The study also found that EDA is a more significant indicator of stress compared to temperature and heart rate. Finally, the project provides recommendations for improving stress detection using wearable technology, such as addressing class imbalance in the dataset and ensuring algorithm transparency.
